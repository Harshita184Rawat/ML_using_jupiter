- Machine learning is a subset of AI(Artificial intelligence)
- In Machine learning we build a model or an engine and give it lots and lots
  of data
  ( to build a program for detecting image of a cat we give it tonns of
  cat images, our model will find and learn patterns and the input data , so we can give it a new picture 
  of a cat that we haven't seen before and give it to it to detect and it will 
  tell us the certain level of accuracy)
- Other Application of Machine learning :
  self-driving Cars
  Robotics
  Language processing
  Vision processing
  forecasting things like stock market, weather, games etc.


  MACHINE LEARNING IN ACTION
( A machine learning project contains a number of steps)
    step 1) Import the data (in a csv file)
    step 2) clean the data (removing duplicate, imcomplete data, converting data into numerical values for use )
    step 3) Spliting the Data into Two segments training and Test sets(input set and output set)
    step 4) create a model (selecting an algorithm to analyze the data from diffrent machine learning algos)
            There are libraries out there that contains these algos
    step 5)  Train our Model (our model will then look for patterns in the data )
    step 6) Make predictions (After looking for patterns we Make predictions)
    step 7) Evaluate and Improve ( evaluate predictions and measure their accuracy , then go back to algo and change it 
            to produce more accurate results or fine tune your parameters to optimize accuracy)

  LIBRARIES AND TOOLS 
    Libraries:
    1) Numpy (provides a multidimensional array)
    2) Pandas (Data analysis library which provides a concept calles data frame
               Data frame is a two dimesional data structure similar to excel spreadsheet )
    3) MatPlotLib (2D plotting library for creating graps on plot)
    4) SciKit-Learn (provides all common algorithms like decision trees, neural networks and so on.)

    Jupyter
    - We use an environment called Jupyter for writing codes
    - we can use other editors like vs code but are not ideal for machine learing projects, because we we need to frequently
      inspect the data and that is hard in environments like vs code and terminal
    - Jupyter makes it really easy to inspect our data

    Anaconda (Download)
    - It will automatically install Jupiter as well as all those popular data science libraries
      like numpy, pandas etc.

    lauch Jupyter

    Importing a data sets (from website called kaggle.com)
    Use r before the path string to convet it into raw string

    green box => edit mode
    press esc to go in cmd mode (i.e Blue box)

    Shortcuts IN cmd mode
    h : to see list of keyboard Shortcuts
    ctrl + ENTER : to run a particular cell

    In edit mode
    . + Tab to see all the attributes and methods
    shift to see what parameters it takes

    larger dataset better accuracy
